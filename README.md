TASK 1 DESCRIPTION: To create a bar charts or histogram to visualise the distribution of categorical or continuous variable.

For the given task I have:
1. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a world population dataset
2. Utilised libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create meaningful visualisations
3. Created a plot for Population Distribution by Continent, created a pie graph for Population Distribution by Continent (2022)
4.Plotted a horizontal bar chart to show the top 5 countries with the largest population in 2022
5. Plotted a line chart of the population growth rate for individual countries to identify trends.
6.Plotted a world map to visualize the top 10 countries with the largest land area by importing geopandas

TASK 2 DESCRIPTION: To perform data cleaning and eda on a dataset. Explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in data

For the given task I have:
1. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on titanic dataset
2. Started by importing necessary libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy.
Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas
3. Utilised Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visually informative plots:
Histograms and box plots for numerical variables.
Bar plots and count plots for categorical variables, heat-maps for correlation analysis.
